# WebApiMiniApp
I created a C# program that retrieves employee time entry data from a public REST API using a GET request. The data is then processed to calculate the total time worked by each employee. I generated an HTML page that displays this information in a table, showing each employee’s name and their total hours worked, sorted in descending order. Additionally, I highlighted rows in the table for employees who worked less than 100 hours, to make them visually stand out.

In the second part of the task, I used the same data to generate a PNG image containing a pie chart. The chart visually represents each employee’s share of the total work time, giving a clear overview of how time was distributed among team members.
